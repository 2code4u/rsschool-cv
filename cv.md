## Information
* I liked mathematics at school, so since then I prefer to solve tasks in the most convenient and fast way.
* In my previous job, I quickly studied the basic functionality of a completely new and first framework for me. Figured out the basic principles of web applications. Studied situations for using the application store, as well as the possibilities and convenience of reactive data for solving logical problems.
* On one project we dont have any design or maket. So I single-handedly created a dynamically expanding page with reactive data filled in and calculated in real time.
* Practiced creating a bundle and writing queries between the web-application and various databases. Mostly for **Elasticsearch** and for **Magento** (2) endpoints.
* Included **Node** libs with **Yarn** tools.
* I skillfully navigate in complex **control flows** with multiple data arrays.
